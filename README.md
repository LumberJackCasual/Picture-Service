# Picture-Service

This application is one part of a larger project complete with a team.  My duty was to build an image carousel and with zoom functionality from scratch.  This was a very challenging and rewarding task as the form of the picture took hold.

This project definitely taught me so many valuable lessons about the importance of ticketing to break down a large tasks into smaller, trackable tasks and how to track completion of those small tasks t communicate progress to your team.

Below is my image service's inspiration, the overstock image carousel.  It has a lot of functionality, including a horizontal and vertical carousel, zoom, and an image modal.

During this project I also increased page optimization by using Brotli and Gzip.  I also kept page speeds high by managing the sizes of my photos.  Optimizing my page also taught me about why certain elements needs roles or alts and how that impact's a page's accessibility
